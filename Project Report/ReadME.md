Keerthanaa added foodPlan method in the GUIDevelopment class which enables the user to select a food plan of their choice. 
When the user selects their choice, a message shows up stating their choice. The foodPlan panel also has a button which then leads the user to the survey page.


_Operations_:
* In the welcome page, the user is at first greeted with a short overview of the application and then has the option to choose between sign up & login. 
* In the SignUp page, the user enters their personal information such as  first name, last name, Email, Password and Retype password. And after going through the sign up page we move on to the login page.
* In the Login page, the user enters their full name and the password they provided in the Sign Up page
* Once they are logged in, they are then redirected to the seat reservation page where there are 4 rows and 12 columns of seats with their designated classes namely First Class, Business Class, Economy Class. 
  * The Empty seats are labeled as green while as the booked seats are labeled as red
  * The user can reserve multiple empty seats.
  * Once the user clicks on any empty green colored seat, they will receive a pop up with Specific information. In order to reserve their seats, the user would have to enter the password that they used for logging in.
  * If the user decides to cancel a booking, they would have to click on the seat that they have booked and re-enter the password in order to cancel their booking. 
* When the user is done selecting their seats, they are then led to the food plan page. The user has the opportunity to select their food preferences such as vegetarian, gluten free or the default food option.
* Then when the user selects the survey button, they are directed to the survey page where the user can comment about their experience in booking the seat. 
* The users are redirected to the home page where new users can sign-up/login. The new users can see other user’s seat bookings which prevents them from selecting those seats.
